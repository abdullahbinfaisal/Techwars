        "Text": "Engineers are working on a new electric train project that will connect different parts of Lahore. The train moves in the following way: It accelerates from speed 0 to the maximum speed at the halfway point of the journey and then decelerates gradually from maximum speed to 0 when it reaches its destination. The power consumed, V units, is equal to the speed of the train. The speed increases from 0 to 1 km/h in the first step and after that, it increases by 3 km/h at every step until the maximum speed is reached. Next, the speed immediately starts decreasing by 3 km/h until it reaches 1 km/h, and then 0 at the final step. Train operators know the maximum speed and want you to calculate the power consumed by the train during the journey. Example: If the maximum speed is 16 km/h, then the speed changes as follows 0 1 4 7 10 13 16 13 10 7 4 1 0 Power needed = 0 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 10 + 13 + 16 + 13 + 10 + 7 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 86 units. Task: Calculate the total power needed during a journey in which the train reaches a maximum speed of 211 km/h.",

Your options are limited and you have decided to destroy three of the battleships in the attack. The good news is that due to the impact of destruction, all the battleships within (or on the boundary of) the impact area will also be destroyed. The impact area of each attack has a radius of 20 units. Given the position coordinates of the battleships, you need to determine the maximum number of battleships that can be destroyed (excluding the targeted ships) if the following battleships are attacked. Position coordinates of targeted battleships: A(50, 150), B(90, 80), C(180, 30) {48,193}, {76,62}, {101,83}, {190,45}, {50,202}, {60,66}, {179,55}, {179,43}, {176, 47}, {49,158}, {40, 135}, {80, 190}, {77,63}, {186,52}, {82,66}, {107,81}, {67,139}, {90,60}, {110,78},{63,139}, {105,65}, {190,48} Note: Each destroyed battleship falls in the impact area of only one attack.",
